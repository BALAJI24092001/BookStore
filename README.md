## Introduction

The main idea for the project is to build a GUI(Graphical User Interface) to create an application to generate a bill for books brought from a book store. For this hypothetical book store, whiche we are temporarily naming it as `chronical books`, we are creating a small database to maintain the book details. Taking general idea from a customer point of view, when a customer enters a books store, say myself, I would grab some books that I might find interesing after some wandering and at the end, I would like to check out all the books at once. So, we have to create a GUI that would give a reciept with more than one book for checkout. In real world senario a book store billing system can also be converted into another form of billing system easily by replacing the original database with more complex one and changing the interaction of the python with database with the graphics.

## Objectives of the project

This project's objective is to use the basics of python and database concepts to implement a billing system. The libraris of python like kivy for graphics and sqlite3 for standalore database are used in creating this application. Object Oriented Programming concepts from python, INSERT, CREATE from sql concepts are used.
